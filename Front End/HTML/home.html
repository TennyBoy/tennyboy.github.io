            Hey there! I'm Tennison Boyce, a 21-year-old full-stack website developer with a passion for crafting digital experiences 
            that leave a lasting impression. From a young age, I've been fascinated by the intricate world of technology, and my 
            journey into web development has been nothing short of exhilarating.<br><br>

            Armed with expertise in languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, I thrive on turning creative ideas into functional 
            and visually stunning websites. But beyond the screen, you'll often find me indulging in my other passions.<br><br>
            
            I have a need for speed, and racing fuels my adrenaline like nothing else. Whether I'm behind the wheel or cheering from the 
            sidelines, the rush of competition is something I can't get enough of. Yet amidst the fast-paced world of technology and 
            racing, I always make time for what truly mattersâ€”family. They're my rock, my source of inspiration, and the ones who keep me 
            grounded as I navigate through life's twists and turns. So, whether you're here to explore my web development portfolio or 
            just curious to learn more about the guy behind the code, welcome! I'm thrilled to share my journey with you.
