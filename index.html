                <p id="aboutParagraph">
                    My name is Tennison Boyce, a 21-year-old media content creator.
                    With passions such as web development and photography, 
                    I strive to bring you the best media content on the internet.
                    I have been interested in coding ever since I was 14-years-old, starting with the 
                    passion to develop video games, I eventually discovered my love for web development. 
                    Since then I have spent my time learning and becoming proficient in coding languages 
                    such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have worked on mulitple projects ranging from 
                    social media platforms to landing pages for small businesses. 

                    I found my passion for photography through my love for cars. I started doing photography 
                    inside of video games such as Horizon: Zero Dawn and Need For Speed Heat. Once I got my 
                    license at 16 I started driving around and taking pictures of every cool car I saw. I 
                    would offer to do free photoshoots for everyone I met until I eventually landed my first 
                    clients, a Dodge Charger and Challenger.
